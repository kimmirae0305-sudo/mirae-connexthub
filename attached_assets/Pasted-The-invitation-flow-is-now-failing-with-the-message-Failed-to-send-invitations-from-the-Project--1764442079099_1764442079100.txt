The invitation flow is now failing with the message "Failed to send invitations" from the Project → Existing Experts view.

In the "Create Invitations" modal, it shows:
- Assign Angles
- "No angles available"

For this test project, I have no angles defined yet, but I still need to send invitations to experts.

Right now, it seems the backend requires at least one angle/angleId, so the request fails and no email is sent, even though SMTP is configured correctly.

Please fix this behavior:

1) Show me the backend code for the endpoint that handles invitations
   (for example: POST /api/projects/:projectId/invitations or /api/project-experts/:id/invite-bulk).

2) Make angles optional:
   - If the request is sent with an empty array of angles (e.g. [] or undefined),
     the API should STILL create the invitation and send the email.
   - Do NOT throw an error just because there are no angles.
   - Only validate angles if angleIds are actually provided.

3) Frontend behavior:
   - In the "Create Invitations" modal, allow sending invitations even when there are
     “No angles available”.
   - The "Send Invitations" button should not be blocked in that case.
   - The frontend should call the same invite endpoint with either:
       angleIds: []     // or simply omit the field
     and handle a 200 success response.

4) Logging and test:
   - Add a log in the backend when invitations are created without angles:
       console.log("[INVITES] Creating invitations with no angles for project", projectId);
   - After this change, I should be able to:
       - Select an expert in the Internal Experts Pipeline
       - Click "Create Invitations" → "Send Invitations"
       - See a 200 response in the logs
       - Receive the email at kimmirae0305@gmail.com.

In summary:
- Angles must be OPTIONAL.
- Lack of angles should NOT prevent invitations or email sending.
- Please adjust validation and the frontend so invitations work even when a project has no angles yet.
