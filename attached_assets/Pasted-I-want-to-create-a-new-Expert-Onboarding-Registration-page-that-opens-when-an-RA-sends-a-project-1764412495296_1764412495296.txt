I want to create a new “Expert Onboarding / Registration” page that opens when an RA sends a project-specific invite link.

The UX reference is a form like this:  
- Login Information  
- Basic Information  
- Experience  
- Biography  
- Hourly Rate  
- Terms & Conditions  

In addition, this form must support 3 languages:  
- Portuguese (default for Brazil)  
- Spanish  
- English  

Please implement the following:

-------------------------------------------------
1) ROUTE & ENTRY POINT
-------------------------------------------------

This form should be the main content for the public invite route:

/invite/:projectId/:inviteType/:token

(You may already have this route; extend it with this UI.)


-------------------------------------------------
2) MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT (PT / ES / EN)
-------------------------------------------------

Implement a simple multilingual system for this page only:

- Supported languages: "pt", "es", "en".
- Detect the browser language on first load:
  - If it starts with "pt" → use Portuguese
  - If it starts with "es" → use Spanish
  - Otherwise → use English
- Add a language toggle at the top-right of the form with 3 options:
  - Português
  - Español
  - English

Use a simple translation dictionary object in the frontend for all labels, placeholders, and section titles.  
Example:

const translations = {
  en: { ... },
  pt: { ... },
  es: { ... }
};

Make sure all visible text in the form comes from this dictionary (no hard-coded English strings).


-------------------------------------------------
3) FORM LAYOUT & SECTIONS
-------------------------------------------------

Design a clean, modern form similar to the screenshot, with these sections:

A) Login Information
   - Email (required)
   - Password (required)
   - Confirm Password (required)
   - Validation: passwords must match, minimum length (e.g. 8 characters)

B) Basic Information
   - First Name (required)
   - Last Name (required)
   - Country (dropdown)
   - Region / State (text or dropdown)
   - Email (pre-filled from login email if possible)
   - Phone number:
     - Country code
     - Phone number
   - LinkedIn URL
   - City (optional)
   - “Can you consult in English?”:
     - Yes / No radio buttons
   - Time zone (dropdown)

C) Experience
   - Repeating block “Add Experience”:
     - Company
     - Title / Role
     - From (Month / Year)
     - To (Month / Year) or “Current” checkbox

D) Biography
   - Large text area for a short professional bio

E) Hourly Rate
   - Hourly Rate (number)
   - Currency (dropdown – at least USD, BRL, EUR)

F) Terms & Conditions
   - Checkbox:
     - “By checking this box, I acknowledge that I agree to the Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy of Mirae Connext.”
   - Make “Terms and Conditions” and “Privacy Policy” clickable links (use placeholder URLs for now).
   - User must check the box to submit.


-------------------------------------------------
4) PROJECT & VETTING QUESTIONS INTEGRATION
-------------------------------------------------

When the invite link is valid:

- Fetch the project basic info and its Vetting Questions.
- At the top of the form, show:
  - Project name
  - Short description (if available)
- Add a new section titled for example:
  - “Project Vetting Questions”
- For each Vetting Question:
  - Show the question text
  - Provide a text area for the expert’s sample answer.

All of these labels/titles should also be translated using the same translation dictionary.


-------------------------------------------------
5) SUBMISSION BEHAVIOR
-------------------------------------------------

On submit:

1. Validate all required fields:
   - Login info
   - Basic info (first name, last name, country, email, etc.)
   - Terms & Conditions checkbox

2. If validation fails:
   - Show inline error messages in the current language.

3. If validation passes:
   - Call a backend endpoint (e.g. POST /api/invite/:projectId/:token/submit) that will:
     - Create a new Expert record
     - Store profile fields (basic info, experience, bio, hourly rate, languages, time zone)
     - Store login credentials (email + password hash)
     - Link the expert to the project with status = "interested"
     - Save the Vetting Question answers for this project
     - If the invite is RA-specific, record sourcedByRaId for this expert

4. After success:
   - Show a confirmation screen, also translated:
     - Example (EN): “Thank you! Your profile and answers have been submitted. The Mirae Connext team will reach out to you if your profile matches the project requirements.”
     - Provide a simple button like “Close” or “Back to homepage”.


-------------------------------------------------
6) DESIGN & UX
-------------------------------------------------

- Use the existing design system of the app (same fonts, button styles, spacing).
- Keep the layout similar to the reference screenshot: clear section titles and good spacing.
- On desktop: form centered with a max width (e.g. 960px).
- On mobile: stacked layout, full width.

-------------------------------------------------
7) DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------

After implementing, please document:

- Where the translation dictionary is located and how to add/edit text for PT/ES/EN.
- Which backend endpoint handles the submission.
- How the created expert is linked to the project and (if applicable) to an RA.
- How to change the default language in the future if needed.
