The bulk invitation flow from the Project → Existing Experts view is still failing.

UI behavior:
- I select an expert in Internal Experts Pipeline.
- Click "Create Invitations".
- In the modal, I see "Assign Angles (Optional)" with "No angles available".
- I click "Send Invitations".
- A red toast appears: "Failed to send invitations".
- No email is received.

This time, I need to see the real error.

Please do the following:

1) Log the backend error clearly:
   - In the bulk invite endpoint that handles this request, wrap the logic in a try/catch and add:
       console.error("[INVITES] Bulk invite error:", error);
   - If the error comes from SMTP / Nodemailer, log the full error message and stack.

2) Expose the error in the API response:
   - When the bulk invite fails, return an HTTP 500 (or 4xx) with a JSON body like:
       { success: false, message: "reason...", details: ... }
   - Do NOT swallow the error or always return 200.

3) Frontend debugging:
   - In the handler for the "Send Invitations" button (Project → Existing Experts):
       - Log the response in the browser console:
         console.log("[INVITES] Bulk invite response (Project view):", res.status, data);
       - If res.ok is false, log data.message as well.

4) Show me:
   - The exact API endpoint being called from the Project view (URL and method).
   - The current implementation of that endpoint.
   - One real example of the failing response (status code and JSON body) from the logs.

5) After you identify the root cause, fix it so that:
   - The bulk invite endpoint returns 200 and { success: true, summary: { total, sent, failed } } when emails are successfully sent.
   - Only when ALL invitations fail should it return an error and trigger the red "Failed to send invitations" toast.
   - SMTP-related issues (e.g. authentication, invalid sender, rate limits) are handled with a clear error message.

I need a concrete explanation of WHY the current request is failing (e.g., SMTP error, invalid APP_BASE_URL, missing field, etc.) plus a fix so the invitations work reliably from the Project view.
