I want to implement the Expert Profile editor for RAs based on this wireframe:

- A card layout titled like "Advisor #12"
- Top-right: two buttons "Edit" and "Save"
- Basic info section:
  - Name       (text)
  - Email      (text)
  - Phone      (text)
  - LinkedIn URL (text)
- Work History section:
  - Table with columns: Company, Job title, From, To
  - Each row is one experience entry
  - Button "Add Experience" to append a new empty row
- Biography section:
  - Large multiline text area

### Business logic

1. When an expert completes the public registration form, their base profile must be automatically created in the database.
   - That record should include at least: id, name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL, and any fields already captured in the registration form.
   - Set default empty values for work history and biography if they are not provided by the expert.

2. This Expert Profile editor is **internal** – only RAs use it.
   - RAs open a profile using an expert/advisor ID.
   - The screen fetches the advisor data from the database and populates:
     - Name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL
     - Work history list
     - Biography

3. Edit / Save behavior:
   - By default, all fields are in read-only mode.
   - When the RA clicks **Edit**:
     - All fields become editable.
   - When the RA clicks **Save**:
     - Validate required fields (Name, Email at minimum).
     - Save changes to the database (update the existing expert record, do not create a new one).
     - Switch back to read-only mode.
   - The profile must always show the most up-to-date information stored in the database.

4. Work History behavior:
   - Each entry has: `company`, `jobTitle`, `fromYear`, `toYear`.
   - RAs can:
     - Edit existing rows.
     - Click "Add Experience" to add a new blank row at the end.
     - Optionally delete a row (provide a small "Remove" or trash icon per row).
   - Work history should be stored as an array in the expert record, e.g.:

     workHistory: [
       { company: "Innotech Solutions", jobTitle: "Software Engineer", fromYear: 2018, toYear: 2021 },
       ...
     ]

5. Biography behavior:
   - The RA writes or edits the biography based on the expert’s LinkedIn profile and/or direct communication.
   - The biography should be written so that it aligns with the vetting questions for the project (no need to enforce this technically, but add a comment in the code).
   - The biography field is a long text column in the database (string / text type).

6. Data model (you can adapt the names to our existing schema, but keep the structure):

   type WorkExperience = {
     company: string;
     jobTitle: string;
     fromYear: number;
     toYear: number;
   };

   type Expert = {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     email: string;
     phone?: string;
     linkedinUrl?: string;
     workHistory: WorkExperience[];
     biography: string;
     // other existing fields...
   };

7. Implementation requirements:

   - Create a React (or the framework we are using) component like `<ExpertProfileEditor expertId="..." />`.
   - On mount, fetch the expert data by `expertId` (mock API or real API depending on current project).
   - Implement local state for:
     - isEditing (boolean)
     - expert data (form state)
   - Map the form fields to the state and to the data model above.
   - On Save:
     - Call an update API endpoint (e.g. `PUT /api/experts/:id`) or equivalent function, passing the updated expert object.
     - Handle loading and error states gracefully (disabled save button + error message if needed).

8. Please:
   - Show me the full implementation of the ExpertProfileEditor component.
   - Include the functions that:
     - Fetch an expert by ID.
     - Update an expert in the database (or mocked service).
   - Make the layout visually similar to the wireframe provided (simple card with sections and labels is enough).
   - Add comments where I should later connect it to the real backend.
