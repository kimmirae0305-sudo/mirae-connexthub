You are working on the Mirae Connext ENS application.

Goal:
Replace the current “Accepted Experts Export” mechanism with a beautiful, client-facing HTML card-style shortlist page — matching the exact UI/UX shown in the attached reference image (Jacob Nelson example). The output must be copy-paste ready for email delivery (Gmail, Outlook, etc.), with clean inline HTML styling that preserves formatting when pasted.

This is NOT a CSV export. NOT a PDF.  
This is a visually appealing HTML shortlist that the RA/PM can directly copy and paste into an email.

REQUIREMENTS
————————————

A. New “Accepted Experts” UI (Client Shortlist Page)
Create a new page under Project → “Accepted Experts” (or a modal/panel):

For each accepted expert (status = Interested / Accepted / Scheduled):
Render a card that visually matches the attached design:

CARD STRUCTURE (replicate exactly):
1) Expert Name (bold, large font)
2) A small tag showing “Accepted” (rounded pill button)
3) Tag area for Angle(s)
4) Section: “Work History”
   - Table: Company | Job Title | Period
   - Show chronological list (most recent first)
5) Section: “Bio”
   - Expert’s short bio or summary (if available)
6) Section: “Comments on Questions”
   - List each VQ from the project
   - Under each question, show the expert’s answer
   - Preserve line breaks and spacing
7) (Optional) Section: Availability
   - List the expert’s available time slots, if any

The visual style MUST:
- Use a white card with a soft shadow
- Rounded corners
- Clean spacing exactly like the provided example
- Professional and client-ready

B. Copy-to-Clipboard Feature
Add a button on each card:
“Copy Profile to Clipboard”
When clicked:
- Generate the ENTIRE card as inline HTML (with styling)
- Copy to clipboard so RA/PM can paste directly into an email
- The formatting MUST remain consistent in Gmail and Outlook

C. Backend Logic
For the project, fetch only experts with a positive response:
- Pipeline status: “Interested”, “Accepted”, or “Scheduled”
- MUST include:
  • Expert basic profile
  • Employment history
  • VQ questions + expert answers
  • Optional availability

D. Frontend Implementation
Build a dedicated component:
<ProjectAcceptedExpertCard />

Fields required:
- name
- angles[]
- workHistory[]
- bio
- vqQuestions[]
- vqAnswers[]
- availabilitySlots[]
- acceptedStatusBadge

Use only frontend rendering — no PDF/CSV generation.

E. Styling
Replicate the attached design exactly:
- Name: bold, black
- Accepted badge: blue rounded pill
- Section titles: bold, slightly larger
- Tables clean and aligned
- All text left-aligned
- White background card, 12–16px padding, subtle shadow
- Border lines between sections

F. Testing
Ensure:
- Pasted output into Gmail looks identical
- Pasted output into Outlook keeps formatting
- Multiple cards can be copied at once
- Korean, English, and Portuguese text renders correctly

DELIVERABLE
————————————

A fully implemented “Client Shortlist” HTML card UI, with copy-to-clipboard HTML generation, matching the attached reference design so PMs can directly paste expert profiles into client emails with no further formatting.
