I want to update the "Create New Project" flow and the Project detail page so that they better match an Expert Network Service workflow.

Please implement the following changes:

-------------------------------------------------
1) UPDATE THE "CREATE NEW PROJECT" MODAL
-------------------------------------------------

Current modal fields:
- Project Name
- Client Name
- Link to Organization
- Client POC Name
- Client POC Email
- Industry
- Status
- Project Overview
- Detailed Description
- Budget
- Start Date
- End Date

Required changes:

1. Remove the "Budget" field completely from:
   - The Create New Project modal UI
   - The Project model/data schema (if present)
   - Any validation or backend logic related to Budget

2. Add a "Vetting Questions" section inside the project creation flow.

   - In the Create New Project modal, add a Vetting Questions area that allows:
     - Adding multiple questions (dynamic list)
     - Each question is a simple text input or textarea
     - Ability to add/remove questions
   - Store these questions in the Project model as:
     vettingQuestions: [
       { id, questionText }
     ]

3. Ensure that when a project is created:
   - The vettingQuestions array is saved along with the project.
   - The Project detail page displays the vetting questions clearly.

-------------------------------------------------
2) EXPERT SEARCH + ATTACHMENT INSIDE PROJECT
-------------------------------------------------

On the Project detail page, I need a full expert sourcing workflow:

1. Add an "Expert Search & Attach" panel or tab inside a project.

2. The panel should include:
   - A search bar to search existing experts in the database by:
     - name
     - company
     - title
     - skills / expertise keywords (if available in the Expert model)
   - Optional filters such as:
     - country / timezone
     - rate range

3. Display the search results in a table:
   - Columns: Expert Name, Title, Company, Country/Timezone, Rate, Actions
   - Each row should have a checkbox to select experts.

4. When one or more experts are selected:
   - Allow attaching them to the current project:
     - Create or use a ProjectExpert (assignment) model:
       {
         id,
         projectId,
         expertId,
         status,        // Invited, Accepted, Declined, Shortlisted, etc.
         vqAnswers: [], // will be filled later
         invitedAt
       }
   - Show attached experts in a separate table inside the project view:
     - Columns: Expert Name, Status, Invited At, Last Response, etc.

-------------------------------------------------
3) BULK EMAIL / WHATSAPP INVITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------

From the list of attached experts for a given project, I need bulk messaging:

1. Add a "Send Invitation" button above the attached experts table.
   - The user can select multiple attached experts (checkboxes) and then click "Send Invitation".

2. When clicked, open a modal to confirm and send:
   - The modal should show:
     - Project name
     - Number of experts selected
     - A message preview including an invitation link
   - For now, implement these as backend endpoints that simulate sending and log to the console, e.g.:
     - POST /api/projects/:projectId/invitations/email
     - POST /api/projects/:projectId/invitations/whatsapp
   - The payload should include:
     - projectId
     - list of expertIds
     - generated invitationUrl for each expert

3. For each ProjectExpert assignment, generate a **unique invitation link** that contains at least:
   - projectId
   - expertId
   - and a secure token

   For example:
   - /expert-invite/:token
   where token encodes projectId + expertId.

4. The invitation message should include this project-specific link so that the expert can click it to respond.

-------------------------------------------------
4) EXPERT INVITATION PAGE (VIEW VQ + SAMPLE ANSWERS)
-------------------------------------------------

When the expert clicks the invitation link (/expert-invite/:token):

1. Decode the token:
   - Identify projectId and expertId
   - Load:
     - The project overview (name, client, high-level description)
     - The vettingQuestions array for that project

2. On this page, show:
   - Basic project summary
   - All vetting questions in order
   - For each question, a textarea for the expert to respond / provide sample answers

3. At the bottom, add buttons:
   - "Accept & Submit Answers"
   - "Decline"

4. If the expert clicks "Accept & Submit Answers":
   - Save their answers into the ProjectExpert.vqAnswers field as an array:
     vqAnswers: [
       { questionId, questionText, answerText }
     ]
   - Update ProjectExpert.status = "Accepted"

5. If they click "Decline":
   - Update ProjectExpert.status = "Declined"

6. Show a simple confirmation message on success:
   - "Thank you, your response has been recorded."

-------------------------------------------------
5) UI / DATA INTEGRATION
-------------------------------------------------

- Ensure that the Project detail view shows:
  - The list of vetting questions
  - The list of attached experts
  - Each expert’s latest status (Invited, Accepted, Declined)
  - An indicator if vqAnswers have been submitted

- Update the backend and frontend so all of this is wired together:
  - Create/update any required API endpoints for:
    - Searching experts
    - Attaching experts to a project
    - Bulk invitation sending (email/WhatsApp simulation)
    - Handling expert invitation links
    - Saving VQ answers & acceptance status

Please keep the existing UI styling (clean SaaS modal style) while applying these changes.
