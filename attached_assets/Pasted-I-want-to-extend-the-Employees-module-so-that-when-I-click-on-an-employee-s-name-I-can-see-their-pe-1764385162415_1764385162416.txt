I want to extend the Employees module so that when I click on an employee’s name, I can see their personal information, individual KPIs, and the accounts (clients) they are responsible for.

Please implement the following:

-------------------------------------------------
1) BACKEND – EMPLOYEE OVERVIEW ENDPOINT
-------------------------------------------------

Create a new endpoint:

GET /api/employees/:id/overview

Requirements:

- Only users with role = "admin" (and optionally "finance") can access this endpoint.
- Use the existing authentication middleware to enforce this.

The endpoint should:

1. Load the employee basic info:
   - id
   - fullName
   - email
   - role
   - status
   - createdAt / joinedAt (if available)

2. Compute monthly KPIs for this employee (current month, timezone "America/Sao_Paulo"):

   If role = "ra":
   - Use the same RA incentive/KPI logic that we already implemented for "My CU Performance":
     - totalCU = sum of cuUsed for completed calls this month that are credited to this RA.
     - completedCalls = number of such calls.
     - incentive = RA incentive for this month, including the R$2,500 cap and 60-day rule.

   If role = "pm":
   - Use the same PM KPI logic as the personal dashboard:
     - totalCU = sum of cuUsed for completed calls where pmId = this employee id.
     - completedCalls = number of such calls.
     - incentive = totalCU * 70 (no cap).

   If role = "admin" or "finance":
   - totalCU and completedCalls should still be calculated for this user’s projects if applicable, but
   - incentive should be 0 or omitted (no incentive calculation for admin/finance).

3. Return the list of client accounts this employee is responsible for:

   For a PM:
   - Find all clients that have at least one project where this employee is the pmId.

   For an RA:
   - Find all clients that have at least one completed call using an expert sourced by this RA.

   For each client, compute:

   - clientId
   - clientName
   - totalCUThisMonth: sum of cuUsed for this employee’s calls with that client in the current month.
   - completedCallsThisMonth: number of calls.
   - revenueThisMonth: totalCUThisMonth * cuRatePerCU (using client/project contract rate, default 1150 USD per CU if nothing is specified).
   - contractedCU (if a field exists on the client or contract model; e.g. monthlyCUQuota).
   - usageRate: totalCUThisMonth / contractedCU (if contractedCU exists; otherwise null).
   - lastActivityAt: timestamp of the latest completed call with this client.

Response shape example:

{
  "employee": {
    "id": "emp_123",
    "fullName": "Sarah Chen",
    "email": "pm@miraeconnext.com",
    "role": "pm",
    "status": "active",
    "joinedAt": "2025-11-01T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "kpi": {
    "period": {
      "month": 11,
      "year": 2025,
      "timezone": "America/Sao_Paulo"
    },
    "totalCU": 12.5,
    "completedCalls": 9,
    "incentive": 875
  },
  "accounts": [
    {
      "clientId": "client_1",
      "clientName": "Test Client A",
      "totalCUThisMonth": 5.75,
      "completedCallsThisMonth": 4,
      "revenueThisMonthUSD": 6612.5,
      "contractedCU": 10,
      "usageRate": 0.575,
      "lastActivityAt": "2025-11-10T15:00:00-03:00"
    }
  ]
}

Make sure all date filtering is based on Brazil time (America/Sao_Paulo).

-------------------------------------------------
2) FRONTEND – EMPLOYEE DETAIL VIEW
-------------------------------------------------

On the Employees page:

- When the user clicks an employee’s name in the table, open an Employee Detail view.
- You can implement this as either:
  - a right-side drawer / slide-over panel, or
  - a dedicated route such as /employees/:id.

UI requirements:

1. Header section:
   - Show employee avatar/initials, full name, email, role badge, and status.
   - Show a small subtitle like “Employee since [Joined Date]” if available.

2. KPI section:
   - Show cards similar to the dashboard:
     - Total CU (this month)
     - Completed Calls (this month)
     - Incentive (this month, only for RA/PM; hide or show R$0 for admin/finance as agreed).
   - Values should come from the "kpi" object returned by the API.

3. Accounts table:
   - Table listing all accounts from the "accounts" array.
   - Columns:
     - Client
     - Total CU (this month)
     - Completed Calls
     - Revenue (this month)
     - Usage Rate (e.g. "57.5%" if usageRate is not null)
     - Last Activity

4. Loading and error states:
   - Show a loading state while fetching /api/employees/:id/overview.
   - If there is an error, show a simple error message but keep the Employees page usable.

-------------------------------------------------
3) PERMISSIONS
-------------------------------------------------

- Only users with role = "admin" (and possibly "finance") should be able to open the Employee Detail view.
- If a non-admin tries to access /employees or /employees/:id directly, redirect them back to the main dashboard.

-------------------------------------------------
4) DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------

After implementation, please:
- Explain how the employee KPIs are calculated.
- Explain how the list of accounts is determined for RAs vs PMs.
- Clarify how usageRate is computed and where contractedCU is stored.
