I want to change the Dashboard behavior for the admin role.

The admin account does NOT need any incentive calculation.  
Instead, the admin dashboard should show company-wide CU and revenue at a glance.

Please update the KPI logic and UI as follows:

-------------------------------------------------
1) BACKEND – COMPANY KPI FOR ADMIN
-------------------------------------------------

Currently we have a monthly CU KPI endpoint for the logged-in user.

For users with role = "admin" (and optionally "finance"):

- Do NOT calculate a personal incentive.
- Instead, compute company-level metrics for the current month (timezone: America/Sao_Paulo):

  - totalCompanyCU:
    Sum of cuUsed for all completed calls this month.

  - totalCompanyCalls:
    Number of completed consultations this month.

  - totalCompanyRevenue:
    For each call:
      - Determine the CU price (cuRatePerCU) from the client/project contract.
      - If no specific rate is defined, use the default of USD 1,150 per CU.
      - revenueForCall = cuUsed * cuRatePerCU
    Then sum all revenueForCall for the month.

Return something like:

{
  "role": "admin",
  "period": {...},
  "companyTotals": {
    "totalCompanyCU": 23.5,
    "totalCompanyCalls": 18,
    "totalCompanyRevenueUSD": 27025,
    "totalCompanyRevenueBRL": 135000   // optional if conversion is available
  },
  "calls": [
    {
      "id": "call_123",
      "interviewDate": "...",
      "clientName": "...",
      "projectName": "...",
      "expertName": "...",
      "cuUsed": 1.5,
      "cuRatePerCU": 1150,
      "revenueUSD": 1725
    },
    ...
  ]
}

For admin/finance users, incentive should always be 0 or omitted.

-------------------------------------------------
2) FRONTEND – ADMIN DASHBOARD UI
-------------------------------------------------

On the Dashboard, when the logged-in user has role = "admin":

- Change the section title from “My CU Performance – Admin” to
  “Company CU Performance – Admin”.

- Replace the current summary cards with:

  1) Total CU
     - Title: "Total CU"
     - Subtitle: "Company CU this month"
     - Value: companyTotals.totalCompanyCU

  2) Completed Calls
     - Title: "Completed Calls"
     - Subtitle: "Consultations completed"
     - Value: companyTotals.totalCompanyCalls

  3) Revenue
     - Title: "Revenue"
     - Subtitle: e.g. "Total revenue this month"
     - Value: formatted companyTotals.totalCompanyRevenue (USD and/or BRL)

- Remove the personal "Incentive" card for admin entirely.

- Keep the “Completed Calls This Month” table, but show company-wide data:
  Columns:
    - Interview Date (Brazil time)
    - Client
    - Project
    - Expert
    - CU
    - Revenue (per call)

For non-admin roles (RA/PM), keep the existing personal KPI and incentive UI.

-------------------------------------------------
3) DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------

Please explain:
- How companyTotals are calculated.
- How CU price per client/project is resolved (and where the default USD 1,150 per CU is stored).
- Confirm that admin accounts do not receive any incentive calculation.
