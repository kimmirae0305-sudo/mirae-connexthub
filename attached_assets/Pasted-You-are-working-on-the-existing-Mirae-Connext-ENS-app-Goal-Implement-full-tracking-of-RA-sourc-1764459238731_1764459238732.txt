You are working on the existing Mirae Connext ENS app.

Goal:
Implement full tracking of RA-sourced experts and the incentive logic based on completed client calls.

Business rules (must be strictly respected):
1) When a new expert finishes onboarding (submits the onboarding form and is registered in the system), the RA who recruited this expert must be registered in the Experts data.
2) For each expert, we must store:
   - Who recruited the expert (RA user)
   - When the expert was recruited (date-time)
   This is required for KPI tracking.
3) Incentive logic:
   - Trigger: Incentive applies only when a “recruited expert” successfully completes a client call.
   - Condition: Experts newly recruited by an RA must complete a consultation within 60 days from the recruitment date to be recognized as part of that RA’s performance.
   - Rate: R$250 per completed call (only for RA-sourced experts that meet the condition above).

Please do the following, using the current codebase structure and technology stack:

A. Data model and database
1) In the Experts model/table:
   - Add a field like `recruitedById` (foreign key to the RA user who sourced the expert).
   - Add a field like `recruitedAt` (DateTime).
   - If there is already a similar field, standardize and reuse it instead of duplicating.
2) Make sure there is a reliable link between:
   - The RA who created the invitation or registration for the expert.
   - The final Expert record.
   For example:
   - When an RA creates an expert invite, store `raId` in the invite record.
   - When the expert finishes onboarding and the Expert record is created, copy `raId` into `Experts.recruitedById` and set `Experts.recruitedAt` to the onboarding completion time.
3) Run the necessary migrations or schema updates to keep the database consistent.

B. Onboarding flow
1) Identify the endpoint / function that is called when an expert finishes onboarding and the Expert record is created.
2) In this flow:
   - Retrieve the RA who initiated the expert registration (for example from the invite, project-expert link, or URL token).
   - Set `recruitedById` on the Expert record.
   - Set `recruitedAt` to the current date-time (time of onboarding completion).
3) Ensure that the Experts list (Experts tab) can display:
   - Recruited by: RA name or email
   - Recruited on: formatted date
   This can be just an extra column in the list view.

C. Incentive calculation logic
1) Identify the model/table that stores client calls, for example `ExpertCall`, `Call`, `Consultation`, etc.
   It should be the entity that represents a completed consultation between client and expert.
2) Add or confirm the following fields (if not already present):
   - `expertId` (link to Experts)
   - `status` (with a value like `COMPLETED`)
   - `callDate` or `completedAt` (date-time of the call)
3) Implement a reusable function or service, something like:
   - `calculateRaIncentives(raId, fromDate, toDate)` (or similar)
   This function must:
   - Find all Experts where `recruitedById == raId`.
   - For each of these Experts, find all calls with:
     - `status == COMPLETED`
     - `callDate` (or `completedAt`) between:
       - `expert.recruitedAt` and `expert.recruitedAt + 60 days`
   - Count how many completed calls meet these conditions.
   - Compute the total incentive as: `number_of_eligible_calls * 250`.
   - Return both:
     - The count of eligible calls.
     - The total incentive amount in BRL.
4) If we already have any RA performance or KPI endpoints/dashboards, integrate this incentive calculation:
   - For each RA, show:
     - Number of RA-sourced experts with at least one completed call within 60 days.
     - Total number of eligible completed calls.
     - Total incentive amount (R$250 per eligible call).
   If no RA KPI view exists yet, create a simple API endpoint or page where we can pass an RA and a date range and see this information.

D. Integrity and edge cases
1) Make sure that if an expert is created manually (not via an RA onboarding flow), `recruitedById` can be null, and such experts should never generate incentives.
2) If a call is cancelled, rescheduled or not completed, it must not generate incentives.
3) If a call happens more than 60 days after `recruitedAt`, it must not generate incentives.

E. UI/UX (minimal but clear)
1) In the Experts tab:
   - Add visible columns or labels for:
     - Recruited by (RA)
     - Recruited at (date)
   so we can visually check that this is working.
2) (Optional) In an RA performance dashboard or a separate page:
   - Show the total “RA Incentive” for a selected period, based on the calculation rules above.

After implementing all of the above:
- Briefly describe in comments or short documentation:
  - Where the onboarding logic is located.
  - Where the incentive calculation function is implemented.
  - How to test the RA incentive feature step-by-step (create RA, invite expert, complete onboarding, schedule and complete call, and then view incentive result).
