Great. Now please upgrade the UI into a fully functional MVP1 system for an Expert Network Service (ENS) called Mirae Connext.

Below are the complete functional requirements.  
Please build the backend, data models, API routes, state management, and fully connect all UI pages accordingly.

===========================================================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR FULL ENS MVP1 IMPLEMENTATION
===========================================================

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React / TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js + Express OR Next.js API routes
- Database: In-memory JSON store for now (later can switch to PostgreSQL)
- State: React Query or basic fetch + useState
- Routing: React Router or Next.js pages
- No authentication needed for now (add simple role flags)

===========================================================
1) DATA MODELS (Please create these in the backend)

- expertId
- durationMinutes
- status       // Pending, Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled
- cuUsed

===========================================================
2) CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
===========================================================

(1) PROJECT REQUEST MANAGEMENT
- PM manually creates new ProjectRequest
- Assign PM as owner
- Assign RA assisting (optional)
- Include overview, client info, POC, and vetting questions
- Status flow:
  New → Sourcing → Pending Client Review → Client Selected → Scheduled → Completed / Cancelled

(2) EXPERT SEARCH & ASSIGNMENT
Frontend:
- Add “Search Experts” button on Project Request page
- Show expert list (existing experts)
- Allow PM/RA to attach experts to the project (ProjectExpert record)

Backend:
- API to filter/search experts by keywords

(3) EXPERT RECRUITMENT VIA LINK
- When PM clicks “Generate Expert Invitation Link”, create a unique link like:
/register-expert?projectId=123&recruitedBy=Mirae
- Auto-fill “recruitedBy” on submission

Expert Registration Form must include:
- fullName
- email
- linkedInURL
- country
- timezone (dropdown)
- whatsapp
- shortBio
- areasOfExpertise (multi-select)
- currentCompany
- title
- hourlyRate
- recruitedBy (hidden auto-filled)
- termsAccepted (checkbox)
- lgpdAccepted (checkbox)

(4) EXPERT INVITATION & ACCEPT / DECLINE FLOW
- On Project page, show list of assigned experts with checkboxes
- Add “Send Invitation” button
- Invitation page: Expert sees project overview + questions
- Buttons: Accept / Decline
- If Decline → update ProjectExpert status = Declined
- If Accept → expert writes VQ answers → status = Accepted

(5) CLIENT SHORTLIST SENDING
- PM selects accepted experts
- Click “Send Shortlist to Client”
- Generate a formatted list including:
  - Name
  - Work history
  - VQ answers
  - Availability
  - Timezone

(6) CONSULTATION SCHEDULING & STATUS
- When Client selects expert → update status = Client Selected
- PM schedules meeting time manually (fields: date, startTime, endTime, Zoom link)
- Update status = Scheduled
- After meeting → status = Completed or Cancelled/No-show

(7) CONSULTATION RECORDING (BASIC PLACEHOLDER)
- Add field for uploaded recording URL (string only for now)

(8) CU (CREDIT UNIT) CALCULATION LOGIC
Implement the following:
- 1 CU = 60 minutes
- Charge in 0.25 CU increments
- If call > 52 minutes → charge 1 CU minimum
- CU = ROUND(durationMinutes / 60, 2)
- Save CU in CallRecord + add to ProjectRequest

Also create:
- CU summary on Project page:
  totalMinutes
  totalCUUsed
  CU remaining (later can add purchasedCU field)

(9) EXPERT DETAIL PAGE
Add full detail page with:
- All contact info
- Bio + work history
- Recruited By (KPI)
- Consultation history
- Hourly rate
- Billing info

(10) CLIENT ORGANIZATION DETAIL PAGE
Must include:
- Organization info
- Assigned MAIN PM
- Total CU used
- Full project history with CU per project
- List of POCs
  - Each POC has own detail and activity history

===========================================================
3) API IMPLEMENTATION
===========================================================

Please implement:
- REST API routes for CRUD of:
  ProjectRequests
  Experts
  VettingQuestions
  ProjectExperts
  CallRecords
  ClientOrganizations

- Endpoints for:
  - Generating expert invitation link
  - Accept / Decline expert
  - Submit VQ answers
  - Schedule consultation
  - Complete consultation
  - Record CU usage

===========================================================
4) CONNECT FRONTEND TO BACKEND
===========================================================

For each UI page, connect to the new backend APIs:
- Fetch lists
- Create/update/delete records
- Update statuses
- Show CU usage
- Pull expert details
- Pull project details
- Pull client details

===========================================================
5) SEED DATA
===========================================================
Please insert realistic seed data for:
- 3 experts
- 2 clients
- 3 POCs
- 3 project requests
- CU history
- Expert assignments

===========================================================
6) FINAL OUTPUT
===========================================================
Once implemented:
- Explain how to run frontend + backend locally
- Describe folder structure
- Summarize all API endpoints
- Confirm that all UI pages are fully connected

===========================================================

Thank you. 
Please begin implementing all of the above step-by-step.
