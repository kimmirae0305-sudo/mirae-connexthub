Expert shows interest

The RA identifies a potential expert (from LinkedIn, referral, call, etc.) who verbally or informally confirms interest in participating in a project.

RA generates an invite link with minimal data

Inside the RA-Sourced Experts Pipeline for a specific project, the RA can open a simple “Invite New Expert” modal.

The RA only needs to input minimal information, such as:

Expert name (required)

LinkedIn URL and/or email and/or phone (at least one contact field required)

When the RA clicks “Generate Invite Link”, the system:

Creates a unique invite token for that expert + project + RA

Stores the candidate + token in the database with status = pending_onboarding

Returns a shareable URL (e.g. /invite/onboarding/:token) that the RA can copy and send to the expert.

Expert onboarding → project details → Accept / Decline

When the expert clicks the invite URL:

Step 3A – Onboarding Form

The expert first lands on the Onboarding form (multi-language: EN / PT-BR / ES).

The form includes:

Basic profile fields (name, title, company, location, experience, etc.)

Work history section

LinkedIn URL, email, phone

T&C and LGPD consent checkboxes, with links to the full documents

The expert must complete onboarding and check the consent boxes, then click Continue.

After a successful onboarding submit:

The expert record is created/updated in the main Experts database.

The invite token status becomes onboarded.

Step 3B – Project Detail & Decision Page

After onboarding, the expert is redirected automatically to a Project Detail page tied to that token’s project.

This page shows:

Project overview (client, industry, short description, key focus)

Vetting Questions (VQs)

Optional text area for “Your sample answers”

Two clear action buttons:

ACCEPT / I’m interested

DECLINE / Not available

When the expert clicks:

ACCEPT → invitation status becomes Interested, VQ answers saved, and the expert appears in the RA-Sourced Experts Pipeline for that project.

DECLINE → status becomes Declined, also visible in the project view.

🔐 Additional Requirements

Every invite link must be unique per expert & project, not a shared static link.

Tokens can only be used once; on reuse, show a message like “This invitation has already been completed or is no longer valid.”

All of this is only available for RAs assigned to that project; Admin/PM flows remain unchanged.

This 3-step flow is the core of how we want RA-sourced experts to enter the system.
Please implement this end-to-end: invite generation → onboarding → project detail page with Accept/Decline.
