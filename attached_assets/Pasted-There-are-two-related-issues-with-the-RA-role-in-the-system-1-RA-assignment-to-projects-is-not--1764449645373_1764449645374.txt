There are two related issues with the RA role in the system:

1) RA assignment to projects is not working.
2) RA users cannot see the "Consultations" module in the sidebar.

Important clarification:
In the Employees module, the role name we use is **"Research Associate"**, not "RA".

Please do ALL of the following.

------------------------------------------------
1) Fix RA detection for project assignment
------------------------------------------------

Current behavior:
- In Projects → [Any Project] → RA Sourcing → “Assign RAs to Project”
- The modal shows “No RAs available”, even though there are Employees with role = "Research Associate".

Expected behavior:
- All Employees with role = "Research Associate" should be treated as RAs and listed in this modal.
- I should be able to assign them to the project.

Required changes:

a) Backend
- Wherever the system queries for RA users (for example:
  - the endpoint that populates the "Assign RAs" modal
  - any RA-sourcing features),
  update the filter so that it matches Employees whose role is exactly "Research Associate".

- If you are using a role enum internally, please map:
    role = "Research Associate"
  to the RA capabilities.

b) Frontend
- Make sure the "Assign RAs" modal uses this updated endpoint and no longer shows “No RAs available” when there are employees with role "Research Associate".
- After the fix, I should see my RA users in the list and be able to Save Assignments successfully.

------------------------------------------------
2) Consultations access for Research Associates
------------------------------------------------

Current behavior:
- Users with role = "Research Associate" do NOT see the "Consultations" module in the left sidebar.
- They cannot monitor calls for their projects.

Expected behavior:
- Research Associates should be able to access Consultations, but with limited scope.

Required changes:

a) Permissions model
- Treat the "Research Associate" role as the RA role in the permission system.
- For this role, grant:

  Consultations permissions:
  - canView: true
  - restrictedToAssignedProjects: true
  - canUpdateStatus: true (for basic call status only)

b) Data filtering
- When a Research Associate is logged in and opens Consultations:
  - Show ONLY consultations that belong to projects where this RA is assigned.
  - Admin / Manager roles still see all consultations (no change).

- RAs must NOT see:
  - any billing, CU usage, or financial fields
  - consultations for projects they are not assigned to.

c) Sidebar visibility
- The "Consultations" menu item should be visible for users with role "Research Associate".
- If there are no consultations for that RA yet, show a friendly empty state, e.g.:
  "No consultations yet. Once your assigned projects have scheduled calls, they will appear here."

------------------------------------------------
3) Quick verification steps
------------------------------------------------

After implementing the changes, please verify:

1) Employees:
   - Create or confirm at least one Employee with role = "Research Associate".

2) RA Assignment:
   - Go to any Project → RA Sourcing → Assign RAs.
   - The modal should now list the Research Associate users.
   - Assign one RA to the project and save successfully.

3) Consultations access:
   - Log in as that Research Associate.
   - Confirm that:
     - The "Consultations" menu is visible in the sidebar.
     - Only consultations for projects assigned to this RA are shown.
     - No financial data is visible.

In summary:
- The system must recognize the role name "Research Associate" as the RA role.
- Research Associates must be assignable to projects.
- Research Associates must have scoped access to the Consultations module for the projects they are assigned to.
