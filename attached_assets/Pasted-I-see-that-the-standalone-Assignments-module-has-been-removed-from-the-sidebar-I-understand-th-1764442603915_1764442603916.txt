I see that the standalone "Assignments" module has been removed from the sidebar.

I understand that the workflow has been moved into each Project (Existing Experts tab), which is good, but I still need a global Assignments overview.

Please bring back Assignments as a read-only / management dashboard, without duplicating the project-level workflow.

Requirements:

1) Sidebar:
   - Add back a menu item under MANAGEMENT called:
     "Assignments" (or "Assignments Overview").

2) Purpose:
   - This page is NOT for creating new assignments.
   - All creation / sourcing / inviting still happens inside each Project.
   - The Assignments page is only for monitoring and managing all expert assignments across projects.

3) Data to show (table view):
   Columns should include:
   - Project name
   - Client name
   - Industry
   - RA / PM in charge
   - Expert name
   - Expert email
   - Invitation status (Not Invited, Invited, Accepted, Declined, Unreachable, etc.)
   - Pipeline status (Interested, Shortlisted, Backup, etc.)
   - Consultation status (Not scheduled, Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled)
   - Last activity datetime

4) Filters:
   - Filter by:
     - Project
     - Client
     - RA / PM
     - Invitation status
     - Consultation status
     - Date range (based on last activity or consultation date)

5) Actions (lightweight, no complex workflow here):
   - From this Assignments overview, for each row:
     - Open the underlying Project page in a new tab (deep link to that project’s Existing Experts tab).
     - Optionally: quick actions like:
       - "Send invite" / "Resend invite" (calls the same API used by the Project view)
       - "Mark as not interested" or update pipeline status
     - But do NOT build a separate sourcing flow here; this is a monitoring and control panel.

6) Permissions:
   - Admin / Manager: can see all assignments.
   - RA: can see only assignments for projects they are assigned to.

7) UX:
   - This page should behave like a global dashboard:
     - Default sort: latest activity first.
     - If there are no assignments yet, show an empty state:
       "No assignments yet. Once experts are added to projects, they will appear here."

Summary:
- Keep the sourcing and invitation workflow inside each Project (Existing Experts).
- Restore Assignments as a global "Assignments Overview" dashboard to monitor all expert assignments and statuses across projects, with filters and simple actions.
