Right now, when an expert clicks the invitation link, they are redirected to the generic login page, which is not ideal.

For invited experts, we want a frictionless flow:
- They already exist in our database.
- When they click the email link, they should see the project details immediately and be able to Accept or Decline without logging in.

Please implement a token based invite flow for experts as follows.

1) Public invite route (no login required)
- The invite link in the email should point to:
  /expert/project-invite/:token

- This route must bypass the standard auth middleware.
- It should:
  - Look up the invitation by the token.
  - Load the associated expert and project.
  - If the token is valid and not expired:
    - Render a dedicated "Project Invitation" page with:
      - Project name
      - Client name
      - Industry
      - Short project description
      - Vetting questions count or preview
      - Expert name (e.g. "Hi, Mirae")
      - Two primary buttons: Accept and Decline

2) Accept / Decline without login
- On this page, experts must be able to click:
  - "Accept invitation"
  - "Decline invitation"

- These buttons should call a backend API such as:
  - POST /api/project-invites/:token/accept
  - POST /api/project-invites/:token/decline

- The API should:
  - Validate the token again.
  - Update the invitation status in the database (accepted or declined).
  - Update the assignment record for this expert and project.
  - Return a success response and a friendly confirmation message.

- After the action, show a simple confirmation view:
  - If accepted: "Thank you, your participation has been confirmed. The project team will contact you with next steps."
  - If declined: "Thank you for your response. We have updated your availability."

3) Security and edge cases
- Tokens must be signed and time limited:
  - Include expertId, projectId, and expiration in the token payload.
  - If the token is invalid or expired:
    - Show an error page: "This invitation link is no longer valid. Please contact the Mirae Connext team if you need a new link."
- An expert who wants to access additional features (full profile, history, etc.) can still use the normal login page, but the invite link itself should not require login.

4) Email template update
- Update the invitation email so the "View Project & Respond" button uses this new invite URL with the token:
  const inviteUrl = `${APP_BASE_URL}/expert/project-invite/${token}`

Summary:
- Invited experts should not be forced to log in.
- The invite link should open a public invitation page where they can review the project and Accept or Decline in one click, using a secure token based flow.
Please implement this behavior and show me the updated invite route, API handlers, and frontend page.
