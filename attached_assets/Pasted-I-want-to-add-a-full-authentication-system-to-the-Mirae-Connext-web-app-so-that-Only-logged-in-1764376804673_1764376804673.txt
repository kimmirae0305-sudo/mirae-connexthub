I want to add a full authentication system to the Mirae Connext web app so that:

✔ Only logged-in users can access all internal pages  
✔ The login page is the ONLY public page  
✔ All other routes (dashboard, experts, projects, CU, invoices, etc.) must require authentication  
✔ Unauthorized users must always be redirected to /login  

Please implement the following:

---

### 1) LOGIN PAGE (PUBLIC ONLY)
- Create a page at /login with:
  - email input
  - password input
  - login button
- This must be the **only** page accessible without authentication.
- If a logged-in user visits /login, redirect them to the main dashboard.

---

### 2) USER MODEL + TEST USERS
If not present yet, create a simple user model (can be in-memory or stored in a file for now):

Fields:
- id
- fullName
- email
- passwordHash
- role (admin, pm, ra, finance, client)

Seed at least two test users:
- admin@miraeconnext.com / password: Test1234! / role: admin
- pm@miraeconnext.com / password: Test1234! / role: pm

---

### 3) BACKEND AUTHENTICATION (API)
Create:

#### POST /api/auth/login
- Accepts { email, password }
- Validates against the seeded users
- On success:
  - Return a signed JWT (or secure token) containing:
    - userId
    - fullName
    - role
  - Return 401 on invalid credentials

#### AUTH MIDDLEWARE
- Read token from Authorization header: "Bearer <token>"
- Verify the token
- Attach the user object to req.user
- If invalid or missing → return 401 immediately

---

### 4) PROTECT ALL INTERNAL API ROUTES
Wrap **all existing API routes** with the auth middleware:

- /api/projects
- /api/experts
- /api/vetting
- /api/assignments
- /api/cu
- /api/invoices
- /api/dashboard
- Any other internal route

If the request has no valid token → respond with 401.

---

### 5) FRONTEND AUTH HANDLING
- After a successful login:
  - Save token in localStorage (key: authToken)
  - Save user role + name in global state
  - Redirect to dashboard

- Add a ProtectedRoute component:
  - If no token in localStorage → redirect to /login
  - Wrap ALL internal pages with this

Protected pages include:
- /dashboard
- /projects
- /experts
- /cu
- /invoices
- /assignments
- everything except /login

---

### 6) LOGOUT FUNCTION
- Add a logout button in the sidebar
- On click:
  - Delete token from localStorage
  - Clear user data
  - Redirect to /login

---

### 7) DOCUMENTATION (REQUIRED)
After implementation, please output a summary describing:
- How to log in using the test accounts
- Which routes are now protected
- How the auth middleware works
- Token storage and redirect behavior

---

Goal:
Make the entire Mirae Connext platform accessible **only** after login, with /login as the only public page.
