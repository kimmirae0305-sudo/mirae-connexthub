I need you to redesign and fully implement the logic for the "Search & Add Experts" modal so that it reflects the following prioritized filters, and that ALL filters work together correctly.

### GOAL
Implement an advanced expert search that supports these filters (in order of importance):

1) Domain Expertise / Skills
2) Industry / Sector
3) Current Employer
4) Past Employers
5) Role / Seniority
6) Geography / Location
7) Experience Level
8) Language
9) Availability
10) Past Engagements

### UI REQUIREMENTS

Keep the 2-column layout but update/confirm the fields as follows:

LEFT COLUMN
- Keywords / Expertise  (text input)
- Current Employer      (text input)
- Past Employers        (text input, comma-separated list)
- Years of Experience   (min / max number inputs)
- Availability          (checkbox: "Only show currently available experts")

RIGHT COLUMN
- Country / Location    (text input, can contain multiple cities/countries separated by commas)
- Job Title             (text input)
- Industry / Sector     (text input, comma-separated list)
- Language              (text input, comma-separated list)
- Past Engagements      (number input: "Minimum Hours Worked")
- Checkbox: "Only show experts with prior project involvement"

If some of these fields already exist, reuse them. If they do not exist, add them to the modal and wire them to the search function.

### DATA MODEL (you can adapt names to the existing schema)

Assume each expert object has at least:

- name: string
- title: string
- skills: string[]            // tags for domain expertise
- industries: string[]        // industry/sector tags
- current_employer: string
- past_employers: string[]    // list of company names
- country: string
- city: string
- years_experience: number
- seniority_level: string     // e.g. "Analyst", "Manager", "Director", "VP", "C-Level"
- languages: string[]         // e.g. ["English", "Portuguese"]
- available_now: boolean
- next_available_date: Date   // optional
- total_hours_worked: number  // total hours in past projects
- projects: Project[]         // list of past projects

If any of these fields do not exist, adapt the code to use the closest existing field and clearly comment where I should plug the real field names later.

### FILTERING LOGIC

Implement a single function, for example `filterExperts(experts, filters)`, that:

- Receives the full experts list and a `filters` object with all the above fields.
- Returns only experts that match **all active filters** (AND logic), where an "active filter" is a filter whose input is not empty / not null.

Rules per filter:

1) Domain Expertise / Skills (Keywords / Expertise)
   - Search across: name, title, skills, bio (or equivalent text fields).
   - Case-insensitive, partial match.
   - If multiple keywords are entered (space or comma separated), match experts that contain ALL keywords in at least one of those fields.

2) Industry / Sector
   - Input: comma-separated list such as "Energy, Mining, Healthcare".
   - Normalize to lowercase and trim spaces.
   - Match if expert.industries contains AT LEAST ONE of the provided industries.

3) Current Employer
   - Partial, case-insensitive match on `current_employer`.

4) Past Employers
   - Input: comma-separated list of company names.
   - Match if ANY of those names appear (partial, case-insensitive) inside `past_employers`.

5) Role / Seniority
   - `Job Title` field: partial, case-insensitive match on `title`.
   - If there is a `seniority_level` dropdown or field, also filter by it when provided.

6) Geography / Location
   - Input can include country and/or city, separated by commas, e.g. "Brazil, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro".
   - Normalize and match against `country` and `city`.
   - If any one of the provided locations matches the expert’s country or city, the expert passes this filter.

7) Experience Level
   - `Years of Experience` min/max.
   - If min is provided, require `expert.years_experience >= min`.
   - If max is provided, require `expert.years_experience <= max`.

8) Language
   - Input: comma-separated, e.g. "English, Portuguese".
   - Normalize to lowercase.
   - Expert passes if `languages` array contains at least one of those languages.

9) Availability
   - Checkbox: "Only show currently available experts".
   - If checked, filter experts where:
       `available_now === true`
     OR (if `next_available_date` exists)
       `next_available_date <= today + 7 days`  (you can choose a 7-day window and comment it).

10) Past Engagements
   - Number input: "Minimum Hours Worked".
   - If provided, require `total_hours_worked >= minimum_hours`.
   - Checkbox: "Only show experts with prior project involvement"
     → require `projects.length > 0`.

### BEHAVIOR

- If no filters are active, return the full list of experts.
- All active filters must be combined with AND logic.
- Implement defensive checks so that missing fields do not break the function.

### IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. Find the current expert search function (e.g. `searchExperts`, `filterExperts`, or the API call used when the modal submits).
2. Show me the current implementation in the response.
3. Refactor it to use a `filterExperts(experts, filters)` function that implements all rules above.
4. Update the modal so it builds the `filters` object based on user inputs and passes it to `filterExperts` (or to the backend API with equivalent parameters).
5. Provide the full final code for:
   - the `filterExperts` function
   - any updated React/Vue/JSX code for the modal inputs and onSubmit handler.
6. Finally, show a small test block with sample experts and filters t
