RA assignment is still not working, even after creating a brand-new RA account.

Current state:

- In the Employees module I now have at least one user with:
  - Role: "Research Associate"
  - Status: Active = true
- However, in Projects → [Any Project] → RA Sourcing → "Assign RAs to Project",
  the modal still shows: "No RAs available".

So the system is still not returning any RA users for the project assignment modal.

I need you to debug the RA list endpoint step by step.

1) Show me the exact backend endpoint that the Project → RA Sourcing → "Assign RAs" modal is calling.
   - URL and HTTP method (for example: GET /api/projects/:id/ras or similar).

2) Inside that endpoint, before any filtering, log ALL active employees:

   console.log("[RA DEBUG] All active employees:", employees.map(e => ({
     id: e.id,
     name: e.name,
     email: e.email,
     role: e.role,
     isActive: e.isActive,
     normalizedRole: normalizeRole(e.role),
   })));

3) Then log the filtered RA list that is actually returned to the frontend:

   console.log("[RA DEBUG] Filtered RA list for project", projectId, raList);

4) Make sure the filtering logic is correct:

   - It should treat any employee with role "Research Associate" (case-insensitive)
     as RA, for example:

       normalizeRole(role) === "ra"

   - It should NOT require the email to match the currently logged-in user.
   - It should only require:
       isActive === true
       normalizedRole === "ra"

5) Frontend side:
   - In the React code for the "Assign RAs to Project" modal, please log the
     response from the RA list endpoint:

       console.log("[RA DEBUG] RAs fetched for project", projectId, ras);

   - Confirm whether the frontend is receiving an empty array or if the data is
     being filtered out again on the client.

6) After fixing:

   - When I open the "Assign RAs" modal, I should see all active 
     "Research Associate" users in the list (e.g. Michael Lee and the new RA user).
   - I should be able to select one or more and click "Save Assignments" with a 200 response.
   - If I then log in as that RA user, I should:
     - See the "Consultations" module in the sidebar.
     - See only consultations for projects where this RA is assigned.

Right now the UI still says "No RAs available", which means the RA list endpoint
is not returning any rows after filtering. Please use the logs above to show me
exactly what employees are being loaded and why none of them pass the RA filter,
then adjust the filtering logic accordingly.
