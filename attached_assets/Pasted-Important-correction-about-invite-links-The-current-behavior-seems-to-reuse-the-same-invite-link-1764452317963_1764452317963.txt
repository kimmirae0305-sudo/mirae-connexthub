Important correction about invite links:

The current behavior seems to reuse the same invite link for a RA–Project pair.
This is not sufficient.

What I actually need is:

➤ Every time an invitation is created, the system must generate a NEW unique invite link.
Even for the same RA and the same Project.

Reason:
- For one project, an RA may outreach 10, 20, or 50 new experts externally.
- Each outreach should have its own invite URL, so that:
  - We can track which specific expert responded via which invite.
  - We can safely expire or revoke a single invite without affecting others.
  - We avoid multiple experts sharing the exact same token.

So the uniqueness rules should be:

1) Invite uniqueness
   - Each invite record (Project + RA + external expert/email or “candidate slot”) must have a unique inviteToken.
   - Example:
     - Project A / RA Michael / Expert #1 → token A-M-1
     - Project A / RA Michael / Expert #2 → token A-M-2
     - Project A / RA Michael / Expert #3 → token A-M-3
   - Even though projectId and raId are the same, inviteToken MUST always be different per invitation.

2) Data model (suggestion)
   - Create an `invites` table (or similar) with:
     - id
     - projectId
     - raId
     - inviteToken (unique)
     - status (pending / accepted / expired)
     - createdAt
     - optional: email or candidateName, if known at send time
   - Each time the RA clicks “Generate Invite Link” or “Create Invitation”:
     - Insert a new invite row with a fresh token (e.g. uuid).
     - Return the URL based on that token.

3) URL behavior
   - Public URL: /expert/project-invite/:token
   - Backend:
     - Look up the invite record by inviteToken.
     - From there, resolve projectId and raId.
     - If token is invalid or expired, show an error page.
   - When the expert completes the onboarding form:
     - Associate their new Expert profile and VQ answers with:
       - projectId (from the invite)
       - raId (sourcing owner)
       - that specific invite record (for tracking).

4) Project & RA level views
   - Project detail page:
     - Show all invites sent for that project (with status).
   - RA view:
     - Show invites that RA has created across projects.

5) Summary

- The system must NOT reuse the same invite link for all experts in a project or for all experts sourced by one RA.
- Every invitation creation event must generate a brand NEW unique token and URL, even if:
  - Same project
  - Same RA

Please adjust the implementation so invite links are unique per invitation, not just per RA or per project.
