Hi! There seems to be a bug with the new “Invite New Expert” flow in the RA Sourcing → RA-Sourced Experts Pipeline section.

🐞 What I’m seeing

When I click “Invite New Expert”, fill in the minimal fields and confirm:

I get a green toast: “Invite link generated successfully” (see screenshot).

But:

No new row appears in the RA-Sourced Experts Pipeline table.

I don’t see any invite URL to copy or share with the expert.

Effectively, the system says the link was generated, but I have no way to access it and the expert lead isn’t visible anywhere.

🧪 Steps to reproduce

Go to any project → RA Sourcing tab.

In the RA-Sourced Experts Pipeline card, click “Invite New Expert”.

Enter basic info (name + LinkedIn URL or email/phone).

Click the button to generate the invite link.

View the page after the toast appears.

Expected:

Backend creates an invite record + candidate.

Frontend receives a response with:

inviteUrl (or token)

candidate’s basic info

The UI should:

Show a small modal or inline card with the generated invite URL + “Copy link” button.

Immediately add a new row to the RA-Sourced Experts Pipeline table with status like “Pending onboarding”.

Actual:

Only the success toast is shown.

No visible invite link.

No new expert row in the RA-Sourced pipeline.

✅ What I’d like you to implement/fix

Fix the backend → frontend connection

Ensure the invite-creation endpoint returns the created record and unique URL/token.

Add logging if the record fails to persist.

Update the UI behavior

After a successful mutation:

Open a confirmation modal (or panel) with:

Expert name

Generated invite URL

“Copy Link” button

Insert/update a row in RA-Sourced Experts Pipeline:

Name

Contact (LinkedIn/email)

Status: Pending onboarding

If the API fails, show a red error toast with the error message instead of the green success toast.

Optional: expose a quick way to re-copy the invite link from the RA-Sourced pipeline row (e.g., “Copy invite” action per expert).

Once this is done, I should always be able to:

See the newly created RA-sourced expert in the pipeline, and

Copy/share the onboarding invite link right away.
