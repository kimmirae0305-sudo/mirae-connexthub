I want to refine the internal permissions of the Mirae Connext app.

Important:
- There is NO client portal.
- Only employees log in.
- Clients are managed as records (companies/contacts) inside a "Clients" module.

I need:

1) An Employee management module (admin-only).
2) Role-based menu/page visibility for internal roles.
3) A simple Clients module (if not already present) for managing client records.

The existing roles are internal only:
- admin
- pm
- ra
- finance

-------------------------------------------------
1) EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT MODULE (ADMIN ONLY)
-------------------------------------------------

Goal:
- Only admin users (e.g. admin@miraeconnext.com with role=admin) can manage employees.
- Admin can create new employee accounts.
- Employee emails use the company domain: @miraeconnext.com

a) USER MODEL / STORAGE

Ensure the User model has at least:

- id
- fullName
- email (unique)
- role: "admin" | "pm" | "ra" | "finance"
- passwordHash
- isActive (boolean)
- createdAt

Use the same storage that auth/login uses (for now a JSON file or similar is fine, but structure it to be swappable to a real DB later).

b) BACKEND ROUTES (ADMIN ONLY)

Create these API routes, all protected with:
- auth middleware
- role = 'admin' only

1. GET /api/employees
   - Return list of all users (employees).

2. POST /api/employees
   - Accept payload:
     {
       fullName: string,
       localPart: string,   // e.g. "diego"
       role: "admin" | "pm" | "ra" | "finance",
       tempPassword: string
     }
   - Construct email as:
     email = `${localPart}@miraeconnext.com`
   - Hash tempPassword server-side and store as passwordHash.
   - Set isActive = true by default.
   - Return the created user.

3. PUT /api/employees/:id
   - Update:
     - fullName
     - role
     - isActive

4. POST /api/employees/:id/reset-password
   - Accept { tempPassword }
   - Hash and update passwordHash.

All of the above must return 403 if the logged-in user is not admin.

c) EMPLOYEES PAGE (FRONTEND)

- Add an "Employees" (or "Team") page that is visible ONLY to admin users.
- In the sidebar, add an "Employees" menu entry under an "Admin" section.
- Show it only if currentUser.role === "admin".

Employees page:

- Table columns:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Role
  - Status (Active / Inactive)
  - Created At
  - Actions (Edit, Deactivate, Reset Password)

- "Create Employee" button opens a modal:
  - Full name
  - Email local part (text input; display @miraeconnext.com next to it)
  - Role (admin, pm, ra, finance)
  - Temporary password

On submit → call POST /api/employees → refresh table.

-------------------------------------------------
2) CLIENTS MODULE (INTERNAL CRM)
-------------------------------------------------

If a Clients module does not exist yet, create it.

a) CLIENT MODEL

Define a Client model with fields such as:

- id
- clientName (company name)
- country / region
- industry
- mainContactName
- mainContactEmail
- mainContactPhone (optional)
- notes
- createdAt
- status (Active, Inactive, Prospect, etc.)

b) BACKEND ROUTES

Create standard CRUD routes, protected by auth:

- GET /api/clients
  - Accessible by: admin, pm, ra, finance
- POST /api/clients
  - Accessible by: admin, pm (and optionally ra)
- PUT /api/clients/:id
  - Accessible by: admin, pm (and optionally ra)
- DELETE (or soft delete) /api/clients/:id
  - Accessible by: admin only

c) CLIENTS PAGE (FRONTEND)

- Add a "Clients" page accessible to internal users (depending on role).
- Clients page includes:
  - Table with columns:
    - Client Name
    - Country / Region
    - Industry
    - Main Contact
    - Status
    - Created At
    - Actions (View / Edit)
  - "Add Client" button (for admin/pm; RA optional).
  - Filter/search by client name, industry, status.

- Clicking a row opens a Client detail view showing:
  - Basic info
  - Notes
  - (Optional) related projects list.

-------------------------------------------------
3) ROLE-BASED PAGE VISIBILITY (FRONTEND)
-------------------------------------------------

I want each role to see different menus/pages.  
Please centralize permissions in a single configuration and reuse it across sidebar + route guards.

a) ROLE → PAGES CONFIG

Create something like:

const ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
  admin:   ["dashboard", "projects", "experts", "assignments", "cu", "invoices", "clients", "employees", "settings"],
  pm:      ["dashboard", "projects", "experts", "assignments", "clients", "cu"],
  ra:      ["dashboard", "projects", "experts", "assignments", "clients"],
  finance: ["dashboard", "cu", "invoices", "clients"]
};

Adjust the page keys so they match actual routes/components.

b) SIDEBAR / NAVIGATION

- Use ROLE_PERMISSIONS[currentUser.role] to decide which menu items show in the sidebar.
- Examples:
  - admin: sees everything including Employees.
  - pm: sees Clients, Projects, Experts, CU but not Employees or pure system settings.
  - ra: sees Projects, Experts, Clients but not Finance or Employees.
  - finance: sees CU, Invoices, Clients but not Expert sourcing tools.

c) ROUTE GUARD BY ROLE

- Extend the existing ProtectedRoute or create a RoleGuard component that:
  - Takes allowedRoles or uses ROLE_PERMISSIONS internally.
  - If currentUser.role is not allowed for that route:
    - Show "Not authorized" or redirect to a safe page (e.g., dashboard).

- Wrap key pages:
  - Employees page → allowedRoles = ["admin"]
  - Invoices page → allowedRoles = ["finance", "admin"]
  - Clients page → allowedRoles = ["admin", "pm", "ra", "finance"]
  - Projects/Experts/Assignments → allowedRoles = ["admin", "pm", "ra"]
  - CU page → allowedRoles = ["admin", "pm", "finance"]

d) BACKEND CHECKS (RECOMMENDED)

- For sensitive APIs (employees, invoices, etc.), make sure the backend also checks the role:
  - e.g., an admin-only middleware for /api/employees.
  - Finance-only or finance+admin for /api/invoices and certain CU actions.

-------------------------------------------------
4) DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------

At the end, please output a short summary that explains:
- How the Employee module works and which role can use it (admin only).
- How client records are managed in the Clients module.
- Which pages each role can see.
- How the ROLE_PERMISSIONS configuration connects to the sidebar and route guards.
